Preparation
1)

2)
a)	The datapt parameter is passed as a pointer to a memory location. It is an output parameter. It is call by reference. At the time of the call, datapt is located
	in the heap?
b)	*********. Little endian. *****. ******.
c)	MOV instruction only copies the contents of one register to another while affecting no flags. 
	The MOVS instruction additionally causes the result flags to be set. 
d)	LDR instruction loads and stores the value of the specified register into the specified address. Meanwhile, 
	LDRB deals with only a single byte. Therefore the three unused bytes are zeroed upon loading. 
e)	The LDR instruction loads the value of a specified register into the specified address, 
	while the STR instruction stores the value of a specified address into the specified register. 
f)	BX LR returns from a subroutine. The previous PC is stored in the LR.
g)	The return value is stored in R0.

3)	StartCritical and EndCritical are added to RxFifo_Init because this initialization needs to be atomic. If it wasn't, you run the risk of something attempting
	to access a Fifo that is only partially initialized.
	Interrupts are enabled because they were enabled in the main function that called RxFifo_Init(). Since the EndCritical function returns the previous value of
	the I bit.

4) 	15-18 cycles. 16/(80,000,000). About .2 microseconds.
